                <h2>About Duo Brew</h2>
                <p>
                    Duo Brew is a franchise café store located in Brgy. San Carlos, Binangonan, Rizal,
                    owned and managed by Mr. Ryzhick Mendoza and his wife. The café began as a shared
                    vision between the couple, who both possess a strong entrepreneurial mindset. With
                    careful planning and dedication, they successfully established the café, which has
                    continued to grow since its opening.

                    The café’s strategic location near a school has contributed to its steady customer
                    flow, especially from students. Duo Brew is also known for offering budget-friendly
                    yet quality beverages, making it an accessible and popular choice among the student
                    community.

                    At Duo Brew, we believe in creating more than just coffee—we create moments of
